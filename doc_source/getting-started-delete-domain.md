# Step 4: Delete Your Amazon CloudSearch Movies Domain<a name="getting-started-delete-domain"></a>

 When you are finished experimenting with your movies domain, **you must delete it to avoid incurring additional usage fees\. **

**Important**  
Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the domain and takes the domain's document and search endpoints offline permanently\.

**To delete your imdb\-movies domain**

1. Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudsearch/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home) and navigate to the list of domains\.

1. Select the checkbox for the *movies* domain, then choose **Delete** and confirm deletion\.

**Note**  
It can take around 15 minutes to delete the domain and its resources\.
