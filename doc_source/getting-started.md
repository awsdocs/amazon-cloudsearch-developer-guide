# Getting Started with Amazon CloudSearch<a name="getting-started"></a>

To start searching your data with Amazon CloudSearch, you simply take the following steps:
+ Create and configure a search domain
+ Upload and index the data you want to search
+ Send search requests to your domain

This tutorial shows you how to get up and running using the AWS Management Console for Amazon CloudSearch\. To make it even easier to get started, we've generated a sample data set of 5,000 popular movie titles that you can download and examine, upload to your own search domain, and submit search queries against to see how Amazon CloudSearch works\. 

Using the AWS Management Console and the sample movie data, you'll have your own search domain up and running in about half an hour\.
