| Change | Description | Release Date | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| New instance types | Amazon CloudSearch now uses newer instance types for new domains\. These instance types provide a more intuitive scaling progression and better performance at the same price\. | 6 January 2021 | 
| Enforce HTTPS | You can now require that all requests to your Amazon CloudSearch domain arrive over HTTPS\. To learn more, see [Configuring Domain Endpoint Options in Amazon CloudSearch](configuring-domain-endpoint-options.md)\. | 13 November 2019 | 
| Support for resource tagging | Amazon CloudSearch added support for resource tagging\. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon CloudSearch Domains](tagging-cloudsearch-domains.md) in this service guide\. | 10 February 2016 | 
| AP \(Seoul\) support | Amazon CloudSearch added support for the AP \(Seoul\) ap\-northeast\-2 region\. For a list of regions supported by Amazon CloudSearch, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html##cloudsearch_region) in the AWS General Reference\. | 28 January 2016 | 
|  Integration with Amazon CloudWatch and support for index field statistics  |  You can now use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your Amazon CloudSearch domains\. CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS\. Amazon CloudSearch automatically sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can gather and analyze performance statistics\. You can monitor these metrics by using the Amazon CloudSearch console, or by using the CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs\. There is no charge for the Amazon CloudSearch metrics that are reported through CloudWatch\. For more information about using CloudWatch to monitor search domains, see [Monitoring a Domain with Amazon CloudWatch](cloudwatch-monitoring.md)\. You also can now retrieve statistics against facet\-enabled numeric fields\. Amazon CloudSearch can return the following statistics against indexed numeric fields in the documents: count, min, max, mean, missing, stddev, sum, and sumOfSquares\. To learn more about index field statistics, see [Querying For More Information](querying-for-more-info.md)\.   |  5 March 2015  | 
|  Support for M3 instance types  |  You can now use M3 instances to power your Amazon CloudSearch domains\. Amazon CloudSearch now supports the following instance types for newly created domains: `m1.small`, `m3.medium`, `m3.large`, `m3.xlarge`, and `m3.2xlarge`\. For more information about newly available instance types and how to modify existing domains, see [Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch](configuring-scaling-options.md)\.  |  10 February 2015  | 
|  Support for Dynamic Fields  |  Dynamic fields provide a way to index documents without knowing in advance exactly what fields they contain\. A dynamic field's name defines a pattern that contains a wildcard \(\*\) as the first, last, or only character\. Any unrecognized document field that matches the pattern is configured with the dynamic field's indexing options\. For more information, see [Using Dynamic Fields in Amazon CloudSearchUsing Dynamic Fields](using-dynamic-fields.md)\.  |  11 December 2014  | 
| Enhanced Japanese Language Processing and CloudTrail Support  |  You can now control how Amazon CloudSearch tokenizes Japanese by adding a custom Japanese tokenization dictionary to the analysis scheme that you use for fields that contain Japanese\. Configuring a custom tokenization dictionary can improve search result accuracy by facilitating indexing and retrieval of domain\-specific phrases\. To learn more about using custom dictionaries, see [Customizing Japanese Tokenization](configuring-analysis-schemes.md#customizing-japanese-tokenization)\. You can also index bigrams for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean\. For more information, see [Indexing Bigrams for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean](configuring-analysis-schemes.md#processing-cjk-fields)\. You can also now use AWS CloudTrail to get a history of Amazon CloudSearch configuration API calls and related events for your account\. CloudTrail is a web service that records your account's API calls and delivers the resulting log files to your Amazon S3 bucket\. You can also use CloudTrail to track changes that were made to your AWS resources\. For example, you can use the API call history to perform a security analysis or troubleshoot operational issues\. CloudTrail also makes it easier for you to demonstrate compliance with internal policies or regulatory standards\. For more information, see the [Security at Scale: Logging in AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Security_at_Scale_Logging_in_AWS_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\. For more information about using CloudTrail to log Amazon CloudSearch calls, see [Logging Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](logging-config-api-calls.md)\.  |  15 October 2014  | 
| Documentation Update |  This update clarifies that you must URL\-encode search query strings and provides additional information about getting facet information for selected buckets\. For more information about bucketing facets, see [Getting Facet Information](faceting.md#getting-facet-info)\.  |  19 September 2014  | 
| Enhanced IAM Integration |  You can now use IAM to control access to each domain's document, search, and suggest services and use AWS Signature Version 4 to sign all Amazon CloudSearch requests\. Requests are signed automatically when you use the latest AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Configuring Access for Amazon CloudSearch](configuring-access.md)\.  In conjunction with this release, there is an update of the Amazon CloudSearch command line tools\. The updated CLTs now automatically sign document upload requests submitted through the `cs-import-documents` command\. You can download the new CLT bundle from the [Amazon CloudSearch developer tools page ](https://aws.amazon.com/developertools/Amazon-CloudSearch/)\.  This CLT update contains just two commands: cs\-import\-documents and cs\-configure\-from\-batches\. All configuration actions should be performed using the AWS CLI\. The AWS CLI also supports uploading documents and submitting search and suggest requests\. For more information, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)\.    |  14 August 2014  | 
| Enhanced Amazon CloudSearch Support in the AWS SDKs and AWS CLI |  The AWS SDKs and AWS CLI now provide full support for all Amazon CloudSearch 2013\-01\-01 API operations, including creating, configuring, and managing search domains, uploading documents, and submitting search requests\. For information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)\.  To generate document batches and automatically configure indexing options based on the contents of a batch, you still need to use the standalone Amazon CloudSearch command line tools\.   |  26 June 2014  | 
| Hebrew Language Support and Desired Partition Count Scaling Option |  Amazon CloudSearch now supports Hebrew in addition to the 33 other [Supported Languages](supported-languages.md)\. This update also adds a new scaling option, desired partition count\. You can use this option to preconfigure the number of index partitions for a domain that uses the m2\.2xlarge search instance type\. If you have a large amount of search data, preconfiguring a domain to use more partitions can enable you to load data faster\. You can also configure a domain with additional partitions to drop the per\-partition document count and speed up complex queries\. Amazon CloudSearch will still scale the domain up or down based on the volume of data or traffic, but the number of partitions will never drop below your desired partition count\. For more information, see [Configuring Scaling Options in Amazon CloudSearch](configuring-scaling-options.md)\.   |  24 March 2014  | 
| Amazon CloudSearch 2013\-01\-01 API |  Amazon CloudSearch has a new API version with many improvements and new features\. The new API is not backward\-compatible with the 2011\-02\-01 API\. To use the new features, you must create a new search domain with the 2013\-01\-01 API\. In conjunction with this release, there is also a new set of command line tools\. Note that the new tools require a Java 7 compatible JRE, so you might need to update Java to use the tools\.  |  24 March 2014  |
