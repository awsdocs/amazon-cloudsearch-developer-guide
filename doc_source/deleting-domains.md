# Deleting an Amazon CloudSearch Domain<a name="deleting-domains"></a>

If you are no longer using a search domain, you must delete it to avoid incurring additional usage fees\. You will still be charged for a domain even if it does not contain any documentsâ€”deleting all documents does not delete the domain\. Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the domain and takes the domain's document and search endpoints offline permanently\. It can take some time to completely remove a domain and decommission all of its resources\. Small domains are typically deleted in a short amount of time, while especially large domains may require an extended amount of time to be deleted\. During this process, the domain status is `Being Deleted` and your account is not charged\. 

You can delete a domain from the Amazon CloudSearch console, using the `aws cloudsearch delete-domain` command, or using the AWS SDKs\.
